Live Demo: [traptrick.github.io/weather-app/](https://traptrick.github.io/weather-app/)

### About the app:
The app uses [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) to retrieve the current weather for the city you requested, and all of that in **Real-Time** as your write the name of the city the app retrives the weather.  
It uses javascript FETCH function to fetch data from the API.

Suggest me if you have any ideas/features in mind that can be added onto this project.
